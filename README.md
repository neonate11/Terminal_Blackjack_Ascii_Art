# About:
I wanted to create a blackjack game that ran in the terminal, drawn entirely in ascii art, 
that required no nonstandard python modules.
I also wanted it to play very similar to a casino, so you can split, doubledown, buy insurance, and play multiple hands at once. 

Let me know if you have any suggestions for improvement in gameplay features to add, or improving my code structure.
Also let me know if you find any bugs.

# How to Play:
Download Blackjack.py, and Card_Graphics.py then open your terminal, navigate to wherever you saved the files, 
then run: python3 [the blackjack file name.py]
